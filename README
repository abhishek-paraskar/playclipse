- https://github.com/branaway/playclipse, branched from https://github.com/erwan/playclipse

 

Features:

 

- The plugin as of now offers the same level of features that are in the original plugin for the  groovy-based templates to the Japid template engine.

  - Commands to navigate between actions and views.

  - An enhanced Play HTML editor that recognizes some Japid syntax, notably the back single quotation mark syntax - the flagship Japid syntax.  

  - Ctrl-click navigation in html views to actions, layout templates and tags. 

 

- It also integrates the Japid template transforming process to the standard Eclipse project incremental and full building processes, thus eliminates any manual process in applying Japid templates while delivering the best possible performance.   

 

- It has also fixed a few bugs coming with the original plugin and enhanced the popup menu in  the views and editors. 

 

Installation:

 

- Just put the jar file in the dropins directory of the Eclipse installation and restart the  IDE. 

- Starting from version 0.6.0, the Japid module (http://www.playframework.org/modules/japid) bundles a distribution of this plugin in the eclipse plugin sub-directory in the module downloads. Please use the jar file in the bundle for best version match.

 


Note:

 

- The plugin has been tested with Eclipse Helios (3.6).

    

Usage:

 

- Right click on your Play project and enable the Play nature to your Play/Japid application in the Eclipse, or the Japid transformation will not be integrated with the project building process, neither the popup menu will display the proper menu items.
